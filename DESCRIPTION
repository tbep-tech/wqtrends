Description: Assess Water Quality Trends for Long-Term Monitoring Data in Estuaries using
  Generalized Additive Models following Wood (2017) <doi:10.1201/9781315370279> and Error
  Propagation with Mixed-Effects Meta-Analysis following Sera et al. (2019) <doi:10.1002/sim.8362>.
  Methods are available for model fitting, assessment of fit, annual and seasonal trend tests, and
  visualization of results.
